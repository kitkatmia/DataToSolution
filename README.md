### Important disclaimer: This model was trained on a tiny sample of 16 data points. The only way to fit a curve to these data points and achieve the >= 0.9 r^2 value we were required to was to overfit the data severely. Moreover, this model doesn't take in account all of the different factors affecting mental health - like COVID, which caused a spike in depression rates - and thus is even more unreliable. Take all predictions with a grain of salt.
